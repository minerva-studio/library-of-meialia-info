Privacy Policy – Library of Meialia
Developer: Minerva Game Studio
Version: v1.0
Effective date: August 10, 2025
Contact: library.of.meialia@gmail.com

1) Who we are
This Privacy Policy explains how Minerva Game Studio (“we”, “us”) collects and uses information when you play Library of Meialia (the “Game”).

2) What we collect
We collect only what is necessary to find and fix crashes and stability issues.
- Crash & error diagnostics: error messages, stack traces, module/thread info, timestamps, app/build/version identifiers, and event/session IDs.
- Device & runtime data: OS version, CPU/GPU model, RAM, screen resolution, language/locale, and basic performance metrics.
- Network data: our crash service may temporarily receive an IP address to operate; we configure the service to avoid storing full IP addresses and to scrub PII where available.
- No marketing tracking: we do not use this data for advertising, profiling, or cross-app tracking.
- No payment data: purchases (if any) are processed by the store platform (e.g., Steam); we do not receive your payment card details.

3) How we collect it
Diagnostics are sent by our in-game SDK when the Game crashes or encounters an error. You can control this in Settings → Other → Privacy & Diagnostics (see “Your choices” below).

4) How we use data
- Troubleshoot crashes and bugs; improve stability and performance
- Security and anti-abuse; service integrity
- Compliance with legal obligations

5) Legal bases (for EU/UK users)
We process diagnostics under legitimate interests (to maintain a functional product). Where local rules require consent for non-essential analytics, we will request your consent first or provide an easy opt-out.

6) Sharing and processors
We share data only with service providers acting on our instructions:
- Sentry (error & crash reporting) as our data processor. We sign a Data Processing Agreement and enable server-side PII scrubbing (including prevent storing IP addresses, where supported).
- Other vendors (hosting/CDN/logging) only as needed for the purposes above. A current list is available on request.
We do not “sell” or “share” personal information as those terms are defined by the CCPA/CPRA.

7) International transfers
Depending on your location and the service region we select, diagnostics may be processed outside your country. Where required, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses).

8) Retention
Diagnostics are retained for 30 days and then deleted. If you disable diagnostics, we stop collecting new data; previously collected data will follow the normal retention cycle.

9) Your choices
- In-game control: Settings → Other → Privacy & Diagnostics to (a) disable diagnostics entirely, or (b) send crash-only reports.
- Uninstall: you can stop all collection by uninstalling the Game.
- Platform controls: see your store platform’s privacy settings (e.g., Steam) for platform-level options.

10) Your rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, restrict or object, request portability, and withdraw consent (where processing is based on consent).
- EU/UK: You also have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority.
- California: You have rights to know, delete, and limit use of sensitive information; we do not sell/share your personal information.
To exercise rights, email library.of.meialia@gmail.com. We may take reasonable steps to verify your request.

11) Children
The Game is not directed to children under the minimum age required in your country (e.g., 13 in the US and up to 16 in the EU/UK). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected information from your child, please contact us at library.of.meialia@gmail.com and we will promptly delete the information and disable diagnostics for that account/device.

12) Security
We use technical and organizational measures such as encryption in transit, access controls, data minimization, and PII scrubbing. No system is 100% secure.

13) Changes
We may update this Policy. We will post updates in-game and/or on our website and update the Effective date above.
